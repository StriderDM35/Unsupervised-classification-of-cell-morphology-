# Unsupervised classification of cell morphology
This repository contains the code for the following paper (submitted): Self-supervised classification of cell morphometric phenotypes as a function of specific extracellular matrices.

There are 3 files in this repository: the first file contains the deep learning model being used, the second file is used for training a model, and the third file is used for classification and cluster analysis. The second and third files can be run directly using any Python IDE such as Spyder or Sublime Text.
