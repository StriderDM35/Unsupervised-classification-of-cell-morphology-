# Unsupervised classification of cell morphology
This repository contains the code for the following paper (submitted): Self-supervised classification of cell morphometric phenotypes as a function of specific extracellular matrices.

There are 3 files in this repository: the first file contains the deep learning model being used, the second file is used for training a model, and the third file is used for classification and cluster analysis. The second and third files can be run directly using any Python IDE such as Spyder or Sublime Text. 

The figure below shows a treemap of the HDBSCAN cluster results (top) and the respective labels for each cluster (bottom)
